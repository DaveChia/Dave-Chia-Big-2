Hi!

This project is a mini game that I am working on that was constructed with mainly JavaScript, the game is not completed as of now.
This game allows you to play with 3 other AI players with a simple logic
The big 2 game is based on a popular game that is played frquently in Asia. You can take a look at the game rules here:https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Big-Two

AI Logic:
1. When AI is playing in response to a single card in play, UI will play the smallest possible card available to them till the biggest card in the deck is played
2. When AI is playing in response to doubles and triples, AI will play the smallest double/triple available to them, till the biggest combination available to them
3. When AI is playing in response to 5 cards, AI will playing combinations in this order if possible: Flush(Will Always play this first if possible) -> Three of a Kind -> Four of a Kind -> Royal Flush ( Will keep to the last when all other 5 cards combinations are played


Here are some of the components of the game that is still under construction:
1. Ability for AI players to play Straights
2. More complex AI logics
3. Score Keeping
4. Improves UI and Styling
5. Game Play Animations
